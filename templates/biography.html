                    <p>Born with a weak immune system, I'd get sick from ever so slightly being exposed to the outside world. Little
                    me was kept inside the house where I'd learn to enjoy indoor activities. This was my life all the way up until
                    my teens. There really isn't much to say.</p>

                    <p>At this point in life most of my health problems had dissipated. I became a regular boy having a regular
                    life, though still sticking to my comfort zone of the sedentary house holed mister mans. However, I'd get involved
                    in big national academic competitions every year called the "Olympiads". I brought back a medal every time I was allowed
                    to participate in them. I also developed interest in software and technology after growing up my entire life handling them.</p>

                    <p>Right after graduating from high school, I left my home country to pursue a higher education in Canada. Moving out to a place I
                    have never once visited and had no acquaintances with was a huge change of scenery. The culture and the geography and just having to live
                    by my own efforts; it's as if I started life anew. But despite all that, I have been enjoying myself every day. There's always new challenges
                    to take on and overcome.</p>
